# War Memories

It has been four years from the end of the war. Four years from the day that everything changed. Four years from the moment that the world became an endless wilderneess in wich law was dictaded by a few amount of tiranical people. Everything became dark, a lot of cities left completely deserted, lot of people fall in the battles, brave warriors, paladins, magicians, archers. Too many lives dissapeared in those bloody battles.
 Even the Sun Warriors, the elite army, protectors of the Good and the strongest among the strong, faithful followers of King Kardan were defeated this day.
 
The fields now are dry, the forests became empty spaces full of giant machines dropping smoke and digging into the earth. Animals now try to hide themselves in the few places that humans didnt destroy yet. People are starving, people are slaves. Grey faces that work without resting, souls without dreams that work every day, suffering. No light, no hope, no future. There only exist the new "Great Rules of Justice", the new moral code that everyone has to follow. Breaking it means death. Forced labor means death.

Humankind can only work until they die, exhausted, and then, they are replaced by others in an endless chain of production.

This is what the end of the war brought. This is what the Valnaar brought.
