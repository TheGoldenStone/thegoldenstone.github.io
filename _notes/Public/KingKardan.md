King Kardan was a brave man. Despite his human nature, he was close to 2 meters tall and weight almost 120 kg. He was like a titan, a big and corageous man who always fought for his kingdom.

Second son of Melgan, the previous king; Kardan found that his older brother was planning to kill his father with the help of the Valnaar people.

He couldn't save his father, but he faced the enemies of the nation in a very well-known battle that took place on the throne room, where he killed Revan (his older brother) and Melsazar (the leader of the Valnaar revolucionaries).

He kept his reign with justice among his people and fury against the enemies until the "Black Day of Windforests", where he fought with all the army to protect the kingdom against the Valanaar.

Battle which humanity lost, and place where King Kardan disappeared.
