King Kardan was a brave man. Despite he was a human he almost reach 2 meters tall and his weight was almost 120 kg. He was like a titan, a big and a corageous man who always fought for his kingdom.

Second son of Melgan, the previous king; Kardan found that his older brother was planning to kill his father with the help of the Valnaar people.

He wasnt able to save his father but he face the enemies of the nation in a very famous battle that took place on the throne room, where he killed Revan (his older brother) and Melsazar (the leader of the Valnaar revolucionaries).

He kept his reign whit justice among his people and fury against the enemies until the "Black Day of Windforests" where he fought with all the army to protect the kingdom against the Valanaar.

Battle wich humanity lost and place where King Kardan disappeared.
